# Virtual-Hand-Mouse
This project lets you control your computer without using a physical mouse.
By using a webcam, it tracks your hand movements and turns simple gestures into mouse actions like moving the cursor and clicking.

How It Works

The system is built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It detects your hand in real time, tracks finger positions, and maps them to mouse controls so you can interact with your computer in a touchless way.
